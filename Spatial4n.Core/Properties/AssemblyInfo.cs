// NOTE: AssemblyFileVersion and AssemblyInformationalVersion attributes are managed
// by the build process in the common CommonAssemblyInfo.cs file. Because we are strong-named,
// we cannot update the AssemblyVersion without making a binary-incompatible assembly.
// However, these dirty details are normally hidden behind NuGet, which uninstalls the old
// assembly and reinstalls the new one. We supply the ACTUAL version number (with a build segment) as the AssemblyFileVersion
// and, if there is any pre-release info, it is supplied as the AssemblyInformationalVersion, which is
// the only built-in .NET attribute which allows us to provide a custom version format.
